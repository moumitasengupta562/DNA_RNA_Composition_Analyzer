# DNA_RNA_Composition_Analyzer
A Python project to analyse nucleotide composition of DNA/RNA Sequence

# DNA/RNA Composition Analyzer

A simple Python project to **analyze the nucleotide composition** of DNA or RNA sequences and visualize it with a bar chart.

---

## Features
- Reads DNA or RNA sequences from a text file.
- Calculates **nucleotide counts** and **percentages**.
- Plots a **bar graph** showing the nucleotide composition.
- Works for both DNA (A, T, G, C) and RNA (A, U, G, C).
